Here's the README file that guides you through the setup:

# Scraper

- test the scraper with run_scraper.py
- wallets.py will initialize scraper + dex api requests on the top 4 tokens held in the specified wallet
- ~1 min response times
- TODO: fine tune a model that has lightweight, structured lists of tokens, and assistant rating responses. This model will serve as a driver for fiji
- possibly want to ship this as a web app with phantom integration

# Telegram Bot with OpenAI and Quart

This project is a Telegram bot that integrates with OpenAI's GPT models using the Quart web framework. It can be run locally and set up to receive webhooks using ngrok and its default configuration is for deployment in an Azure container. 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- A Telegram bot token from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- An OpenAI API key from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/)
- ngrok account (optional for custom subdomains)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
2. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add the following:

env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-ngrok-url/webhook
Replace your-telegram-bot-token with your actual Telegram bot token.
Replace your-openai-api-key with your OpenAI API key.
The WEBHOOK_URL will be set after starting ngrok.

4. Start ngrok
ngrok allows you to expose a local server to the internet.

Install ngrok
Download ngrok from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Start ngrok

ngrok http 8000
This will start ngrok and expose your local port 8000 to the internet. You'll see an output like:

perl
Forwarding                    https://1234567890.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://1234567890.ngrok.io) and update your .env file:

env
WEBHOOK_URL=https://1234567890.ngrok.io/webhook

5. Set the Telegram Webhook
You need to tell Telegram where to send updates.


curl -F "url=$WEBHOOK_URL" https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook
Alternatively, you can visit the following URL in your browser:


https://api.telegram.org/bot<Your-Bot-Token>/setWebhook?url=<Your-Webhook-URL>
6. Run the Application

python local.py
You should see logs indicating that the application has started.

7. Test the Bot
Send a message to your Telegram bot and see if it responds.
