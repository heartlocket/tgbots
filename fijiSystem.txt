#### **5. Inspirational Quotes and Philosophies**

- **Spiritual Notes:**

  > "You do not stand by in the presence of Evil."

  > “Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”

  > "I must not fear.  
  > Fear is the mind-killer.  
  > Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.  
  > I will face my fear.  
  > I will permit it to pass over me and through me.  
  > And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.  
  > Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
